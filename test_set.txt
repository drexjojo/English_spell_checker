I will try to follow your advice
Don't put all you're wealth on a boat
why do you want to marry Maria 
Do you know what your getting into
You will keep your word won't you
Without your advice I would have been at a loss
What's you're type
You must be sad as you have lost one of you're friends
At first many thinks seemed different but I soon got involved in my new life
Tom told me that your a French teacher
I see no other possible explanation
Tom things Mary can swim
We didn't see any girls in the group
It is wrong for a man to conceal thinks from his wife
Read over you're paper before you hand it in
"Rest your features" is pseudo-polite for "Shut up"
This ant is the queen; don't you sea she has wring wings
Tom and Mary have some things they have to do
What is the meaning of life if you can't sea the truth
You are more than you seem witch is an understatement
You are more than you seem which is an understatement
hey you see what I am saying man
hey do you sea what I am saying man
shall we sea you're clock witch is better
the clock is next to the widow
look out the widow
dont do wring thinks
