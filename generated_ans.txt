i will try to follow your advice
don't put all your wealth on a boat
why do you want to marry maria
do you know what you're getting into
you will keep your word won't you
without your advice i would have been at a loss
what's your type
you must be sad as you have lost one of your friends
at first many things seemed different but i soon got involved in my new life
tom told me that you're a french teacher
i see no other possible explanation
tom thinks mary can swim
we didn't see any girls in the group
it is wrong for a man to conceal things from his wife
read over your paper before you hand it in
"rest your features" is pseudo-polite for "shut up"
this ant is the queen; don't you see she has wrong wings
tom and mary have some things they have to do
what is the meaning of life if you can't see the truth
you are more than you seem which is an understatement
you are more than you seem which is an understatement
hey you see what i am saying man
hey do you see what i am saying man
shall we see you're clock which is better
the clock is next to the window
look out the window
don't do wrong things
